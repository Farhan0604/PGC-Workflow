# PGC-Workflow

An automated **Platform Generated Content (PGC)** creation workflow built in [n8n](https://n8n.io).  
It takes a userâ€™s text prompt, refines it into a detailed and structured description with consistent characters, generates AI images, and stitches them together into a short video.


## ðŸš€ Features
- **Prompt Refinement** â€“ Converts a simple user prompt into a rich, detailed, and character-consistent description.
- **AI Image Generation** â€“ Creates high-quality images based on the refined prompt.
- **Character Consistency** â€“ Ensures that characters and visual elements remain consistent across all generated images.
- **Automated Video Creation** â€“ Stitches generated images into a short, cohesive video file.
- **End-to-End Automation** â€“ No manual editing required from text to video.
